    "\n",
    "* Insertion of lunch breaks has been moved to develop_detailed_schedule().\n",
    "* Model parameters are indicated by ##### inside the code.\n",
    "* Pedestrian and car network data updated, with parking lots, dorms, lunch places, and inside rooms.\n",
    "* Parking lots are also included in the car network.\n",
    "* Node mapping rules are imported from note-mapping.txt.\n",
    "* Agents develop detailed schedule from the studentdata file.\n",
    "* Constructed networks and agents are pickled and then reloaded at each re-initialization.\n",
    "* Bus stops were introduced and 50% of car commuters were assumed to \"park\" at bus stops.\n",
    "* Visualization was revised to change the node size of parking lots and classrooms based on the number of occupants.\n",
    "* Parking spaces were assigned according to parking capacities.\n",
    "* Close contacts are monitored and visualized in a density plot (currently only among moving pedestrians).\n",
    "* Close contact detection was optimized by using neighbor dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Revisions after meeting with President Stenger (5/30/2020):\n",
    "* Road and path networks have been updated to correct errors and to include ITC.\n",
    "* Roads to ITC and food place/parking lots/bus stop at ITC were added.\n",
    "* Visualization was revised so that node sizes would represent the actual number more accurately.\n",
    "* Faculty/staff and grad research assistants were also added, following actual employee data.\n",
    "    * Now nearly 17k agents! ({'UG': 12752, 'GD': 1162, 'GRA': 375, 'FC': 803, 'SF': 1880})\n",
    "* Individual speed and time sensitivity variations were increased to make simulation results more natural and smooth.\n",
    "* Walking speed is gradually decreased to 83/2 = 41.5 m/min as a function of the most recent contact density at each location.\n",
    "* Agents' preference for Marketplace was implemented.\n",
    "* Parking usage was monitored and model parameters were calibrated accordingly.\n",
    "    * Overnight parking numbers were included.\n",
    "    * Students who can't find a parking spot are automatically converted to bus-commuting.\n",
    "    * Paid parking places were considered more costly in terms of distance (to discourage their use).\n",
    "* Inside room capacity information was included and utilized for close contact detection.\n",
    "* Keeping culumative contacts density map and plotting it at the end.\n",
    "* Density sweep experiment was conducted.\n",
    "* Shortest path length calculation was improved by dynamic programming.\n",
    "* Many minor bugs were fixed.\n",
    "* Frame-by-frame animation was implemented."
