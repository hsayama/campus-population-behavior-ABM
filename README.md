# High-Resolution Agent-Based Modeling of Campus Population Behaviors for Pandemic Response Planning: Simulator Code and Visualizations

This folder hosts the simulator code and a few animated visualizations of simulation results related to the following paper:
* Sayama, H. & Cao, S. (2024). High-Resolution Agent-Based Modeling of Campus Population Behaviors for Pandemic Response Planning, *arxiv* https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11414 .

Here are the contents:
* campus-traffic-model.ipynb
  - The Jupyter notebook that contains the simulator code. This is a verbatim copy of the file completed on June 5th, 2020, with lots of notes, remarks, some outputs and even warning messages in it. Note that you cannot run this code as is, because it requires a lot of external data files (which I do not have the right to share publicly). This code is shared only for informational purposes. It may not display in a preview mode on GitHub; if this is the case, please download the notebook file and look at it locally.
* animation-1.0-density-compressed.mp4
  - Simulation result with 100% population density.
* animation-0.5-density-compressed.mp4
  - Simulation result with 50% population density.
* animation-0.25-density-compressed.mp4
  - Simulation result with 25% population density.

Please refer to the above paper for additional details. Feel free to email sayama@binghamton.edu for any questions.
